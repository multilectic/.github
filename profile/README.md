  <b>Multilectic</b> is an expanded philosophical approach that transcends the binary structure of 
  discourse and adopts a multidimensional perspective. Multilectic encourages thinkers to engage 
  in parallel lines of reasoning, acknowledging the existence of multiple truths based on various 
  subsets of facts, individual presuppositions and assumptions that each entity uses in reasoning. 
  By embracing multiplicity and interconnectedness, multilectic provides a dynamic framework for 
  philosophical exploration that goes beyond the limitations of traditional discourse.
