# Multilectic
<pre>
  <b>Multilectic</b> is an expanded philosophical approach that transcends the binary structure of 
  discourse and adopts a multidimensional perspective. Multilectic encourages thinkers to engage 
  in parallel lines of reasoning, acknowledging the existence of multiple truths based on various 
  subsets of facts and individual presuppositions that each entity uses in reasoning. 
  By embracing multiplicity and interconnectedness, multilectic provides a flexible and dynamic 
  framework for philosophical exploration that goes beyond the limitations of traditional discourse.
