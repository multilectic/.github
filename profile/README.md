  <b>Multilectic</b> is an expanded philosophical approach that transcends the binary structure of discourse 
  and adopts a multidimensional perspective. Multilectic encourages thinkers to engage in parallel lines of 
  reasoning, acknowledging the existence of multiple truths based on various subsets of facts, individual 
  presuppositions and assumptions that each entity uses in reasoning. Everyone can in fact be right if nobody 
  insists on being the only one to be right.

  <b>Multilectic</b> is a philosophy behind <b>Multilogue</b> - the cooperative game of reasoning entities
  against their own ignorance, confusion and misunderstanding.
